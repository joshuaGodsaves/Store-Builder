Good day sir/ma, 
        I am joshua, from Jos diocese. i am writing concerning the vowtelevision website, and other opportunities that could be utilized for the ministry. i believe the vowtv website could be upgraded to meet more needs and cover various aspects. I'm only suggesting as a youth born in this great ministry,   the site is doing well but can still accommodate more and better upgrades. Their are many more opportunities on the internet that could be utilized for the ministry. 

Areas that could be worked on 
SMS, Whatsapp and various social media automation.
Instagram, Facebook automation for advertisement... 
Custom made apps for vow and many more.

Thank you for reading
